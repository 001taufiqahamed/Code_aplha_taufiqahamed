this is my project on Predictive Modeling using Linear Regression! In this project, I imported the libraries like numpy,pandas,matplotlib and seaborn and utilized the power of linear regression to build a predictive model that forecasts a numerical outcome based on multiple features. By leveraging a dataset with a continuous target variable, I was able to train,test and evaluate the model's performance accurately.
By understanding how these variables interact, we can make predictions about future outcomes.
