for task1- predictive modeling with leanier regression

this is my project on Predictive Modeling using Linear Regression! In this project, I imported the libraries like numpy,pandas,matplotlib and seaborn and utilized the power of linear regression to build a predictive model that forecasts a numerical outcome based on multiple features. By leveraging a dataset with a continuous target variable, I was able to train,test and evaluate the model's performance accurately.
By understanding how these variables interact, we can make predictions about future outcomes.









For Task 3: A/B Testing

I created a program that simulates A/B test data for two groups, visualizing their distributions to get a sense of the differences. I used an independent t-test to check if there’s a statistically significant difference between the groups. The program calculates the t-statistic and p-value, helping me determine if the intervention had any real impact. I also computed Cohen's d to measure the effect size and understand how strong the effect is. Based on these results, I can draw actionable insights and make informed decisions.
